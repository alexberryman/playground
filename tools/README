Tools for Django/Nginx
======================

Server management helpers for my setup:

* makeuser.sh: create user, database and web directory for a new project
* nginxsite.sh: start/stop one Django site running on fcgi behind Nginx
* websites-init.sh: start/stop/restart all Django sites (use e.g. as startup script)
* copysite.sh: copy a complete site from another server (use for server migrations)
* server-setup.rst: some hints what to do with a new (virtual) server
* package.list: my selection of installed packages on a new virtual server with Debian 5.0 (Lenny)

Some of these functions will migrate to the fabfile sometime...
